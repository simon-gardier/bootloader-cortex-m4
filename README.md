# Bootloader for STM32F303 MCU

Bootloader for Cortex M4 MCU (STM32F303) with updates over CAN bus.
In the context of the RoboCup competition, the RoboCup Montefiore Team at ULi√®ge developed its own bootloader for the MCU of the servomotors in the robot architecture.
I was personally responsible for documenting the STM32F303 MCU and bootloader, as well as its implementation.
See [report](https://github.com/simon-gardier/bootloader-cortex-m4/blob/main/Bootloader.pdf) for more details.
